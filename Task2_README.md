# Task 2 - Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

## Objective:
To build a simple linear regression model that predicts student scores based on hours studied.

## Dataset:
- `Task2_student_scores.csv` — contains hours studied and scores obtained.

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Steps Performed:
1. Loaded the dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Trained a Linear Regression model
4. Predicted scores on the test set
5. Evaluated the model using MAE and R²
6. Plotted the regression line for visualization
